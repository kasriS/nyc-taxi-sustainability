# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction for Sustainable Urban Transport

## 🌍 Contributing to UN Sustainable Development Goals

This project leverages machine learning to predict NYC taxi trip durations, contributing to sustainable urban development by:
- **SDG 11**: Building sustainable cities through smart transport
- **SDG 13**: Climate action via emission reduction
- **SDG 9**: Innovation in urban infrastructure

## 🎯 Research Question

**How can machine learning-based trip duration prediction contribute to sustainable urban transport and reduce carbon emissions in NYC?**

## 📊 Datasets

1. **NYC Taxi Trip Duration** (Kaggle)
   - 1.5M+ taxi trips with pickup/dropoff coordinates and timestamps
   - Source: [Kaggle NYC Taxi Trip Duration](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration)

2. **Weather Data**
   - Historical NYC weather conditions
   - Temperature, precipitation, wind speed, visibility

3. **Holiday/Events Data**
